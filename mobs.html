     <center><h1>Mobs</h1></center>
    <dt>Zombie</dt>
  <dd>Zombies are common undead hostile mobs that deal melee damage and attack in groups.</dd>
<dt>Creeper</dt>
  <dd>A creeper is a common hostile mob that silently approaches players and then explodes, which can destroy blocks and kill unarmored players on any difficulty (except for peaceful). When struck by lightning, a creeper becomes a charged creeper, which amplifies its explosion power and enables mob heads to be obtained from piglinsâ€Œ, zombies, skeletons and other creepers it kills. Due to its distinctive appearance and unique and destructive method of attack, the creeper has become one of the most iconic mobs of Minecraft, being featured in promotional material and merchandise.</dd>
<dt>Cat</dt>
  <dd>A cat is a passive mob found in villages and swamp huts. They can be tamed and used to repel creepers and phantoms.</dd>
<dt>Sheep</dt>
  <dd>Sheep are common passive mobs that supply wool and mutton and are found in many of the grassy biomes.</dd>
<dt>Enderman</dt>
  <dd>An enderman is a tall neutral mob found in all three dimensions. Endermen normally ignore players but run to attack those that damage it or look directly at its face. Endermen teleport to avoid water (which harms them), sunlight, projectiles and some other damage sources, and they occasionally pick up certain blocks.</dd>
